Insomnia does not automatically detect system-wide proxy settings but a proxy can be set up manually if needed. From the settings menu, set the HTTP Proxy and/or HTTPS Proxy to the location of your proxy server and all future requests will be rerouted.

## Authentication
If your proxy needs authentication, you can include the credentials in the URL.

`http://username:password@localhost:8005`
