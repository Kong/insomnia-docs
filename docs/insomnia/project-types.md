With Insomnia 2021.5, Projects introduces a way to group Request Collections and Design Documents.

A Project can be activated from the Dashboard and the Dashboard will filter to only show the Collections and Documents within the selected Project.

## Project Types

There are three types of Projects: Default, Local, and Remote.

_Projects are available via the main Insomnia dropdown. Here, you will find the Default Project listed first next to the home icon._

### Default Project
This is a persistent Project that always exists for all users by default. It cannot be renamed or deleted. It appears next to the home icon in the Projects dropdown menu. 

### Local Project
A local project can be created locally within the application to group Collections and Documents. This only exists on your client, it is not included in any export file, and is not part of your sync data.

### Remote Project
If you are signed in and have access to a Team with Insomnia Sync enabled, that Team will be represented as a Remote Project on your client. When opening the Projects dropdown, Remote Projects that you have access to will automatically appear in the list.

When creating a Request Collection inside a Remote Project, Insomnia will attempt to automatically enable sync. Collections that have been synced into a Remote Project can be pulled from the Dashboard after activating the Remote Project. For instance, inside the Insomnia Testing remote project, a user can pull Collections.
