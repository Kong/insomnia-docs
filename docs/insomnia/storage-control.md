**Note**: This feature is only available for Enterprise subscriptions.

With Storage Controls, you can mandate how personal projects should be stored for the enterprise users associated with your license.

You can also mandate how projects should be stored across all collaborators in your organizations and create custom rules for specific organizations.

The following storage options are available:

- **Cloud Sync and Local Vault**: Your users can have both local and cloud projects.
- **Cloud Sync Only**: Only cloud projects are allowed.
- **Local Vault Only**: Only local projects (including Git Sync projects) are allowed.

You can define these controls for all organizations or override the setting on a per-organization basis. For example, you might want certain teams or parts of your enterprise to store projects only locally or only in the cloud, as opposed to the settings you might want for the rest of your enterprise.

After you set a given control, the users impacted by that control will receive a warning in the Insomnia app to update their projects according to the mandated storage control.
