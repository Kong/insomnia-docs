<!-- for rework: this page should contain a very easy, short example of how to import a spec into Insomnia. We should also provide some information in the introduction paragraph about what a spec is and why you'd want to use one or need one. You can use this doc as an example: https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI -->
