title: Add a pre-request script
---

<!-- for rework: needs to include info about pre-request scripts for **collections**, what they do, why you'd use them. Should also include a short, easy tutorial where users can try out their first pre-request script, for example, see https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/#scripting-before-your-request-runs   (it should be a simple example, we can explain more examples and use cases and features in a different topic)-->
