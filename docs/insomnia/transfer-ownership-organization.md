## Final Check and Confirmation

- Once you have completed these steps, Insomnia App will typically send a confirmation email to both you (the current owner) and the new owner. Make sure both parties receive this email.
- Confirm that the new owner can access the enterprise controls by having them log in and check their access.
- The new owner needs to accept the transfer invite on their account.
