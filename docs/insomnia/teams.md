Teams gives you the ability to collaborate on Insomnia Request Collections with other people. Once a Request Collection is shared with a team, data is made available to everyone on the team once pushed.

## Create a Team

A team can be created in the [web dashboard](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/signup/).

## Share Request Collections With a Team

In the Insomnia client, sync can only be enabled on a Request Collection that is created within a Remote Project. Once sync is enabled, that collection is shared with all members of the team/space.

**Note**: All synchronized data is first encrypted before being sent over the network, meaning that even Insomnia's servers cannot access your sensitive data.

Once a collection is synced into a remote project, team members that have access to the project will see shared request collections appear under the Pull button on the Dashboard when the project is activated.

## Share Request Collections With a Different Team

A Request Collection cannot be moved into a different project, but it can be duplicated into a different project, and sync enabled on the newly duplicated collection. A Collection can be duplicated from the Dashboard.
