Teams gives you the ability to collaborate on Insomnia Request Collections with other people. Once a Request Collection is shared with a team, data is made available to everyone on the team once pushed.

## Create a Team

A team can be created in the [web dashboard](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/signup/).

### Adding Team Members to Insomnia Team

On the Insomnia Accounts [dashboard](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/account/), click **Manage Team**.  On the Team List Page, click on **Manage Team** next to the Team Name of the team you want to add members to.  

This will open the Team Management page. Enter the email of the Insomnia Account you want to add to your team in the **Add by Email** box.  Click **Add**

### Promote Member to Admin
Admin users on a team have the power to add and remove other team members on the team.  To promote an Insomnia User as admin, go to your [Insomnia Dashboard](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/account/).  Click **Manage Team**.  On the Team List Page, click on **Manage Team** next to the Team Name of the team you want to create admins in.

This will open the Team Management page.  Click **promote to admin** next to the name of the users you want to promote to admin.

## Share Request Collections With a Team

In the Insomnia client, sync can only be enabled on a Request Collection that is created within a Remote Project. Once sync is enabled, that collection is shared with all members of the team/space.

{:.alert .alert-primary}
**Note**: All synchronized data is first encrypted before being sent over the network, meaning that even Insomnia's servers cannot access your sensitive data.

Once a collection is synced into a remote project, team members that have access to the project will see shared request collections appear under the Pull button on the Dashboard when the project is activated.

## Share Request Collections With a Different Team

A Request Collection cannot be moved into a different project, but it can be duplicated into a different project, and sync enabled on the newly duplicated collection. A Collection can be duplicated from the Dashboard.
