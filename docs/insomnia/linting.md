Linting is built into Insomnia for Design Documents. As you type, Insomnia validates your spec in the background for issues. Errors are indicated by a red dot next to the line number.

The Linter Panel aggregates all errors and warnings from the spec into a centralized location so it’s easier to get an overall sense of what’s going wrong without scrolling through and checking each individual line.

_Errors are displayed next to the applicable code line, and in the Linter Panel below the editor._
