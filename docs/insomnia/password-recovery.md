**Note**: If you already know your password and want to change it, login to your account and change your password from the web (not the client application).

For your security, your Insomnia password is:

* never transmitted over the Internet
* never logged locally
* never known to us at Insomnia
* only known to you
* the only way to decrypt your data

This ensures that your data is safe from intruders, but it also means that no one can reset your password.  Read more about how your data is protected in the Security Overview.
