Design Documents (also called Documents) are a space to work with API specs - from designing to debugging to testing - all within Insomnia.

## Find Your Documents

Documents are accessible through the Dashboard of your Project.

If you don't see a Document or Collection you're looking for, ensure you're in the right [Project](/insomnia/projects) by clicking on the Insomnia dropdown menu. Note that the dropdown title will be **Insomnia** if you're in the default Project.  

![Click Dashboard in the upper left-hand corner to return to a listing of your Documents and Collections.](/assets/images/access-dashboard.png)
_From inside a Document or Collection, return to your listings by clicking on your Project name. In this case, the Project name is Insomnia._

For information about working with Collections, see [Request Collections](/insomnia/request-collections).
