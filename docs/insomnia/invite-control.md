To access it, enterprise owner needs to go into their Enterprise Controls and then into Invite Controls

With the new Invite Control enterprise capability, you can now determine what domains are allowed to be invited to work on your organizations and projects. This ensures that external users aren't mistakenly invited.

While the decision to invite someone is still 100% in the control of the organization's admins, setting up Invite Control rules further ensures that only approved domains can be added to your projects, collections, and design specs. For example, if an admin has mistakenly invited someone that they shouldn't have (such as a user with a personal email address instead of a corporate email), Invite Control can catch the error immediately and prevent the invite from being sent.

The capability to invite users to an organization can be entirely disabled with the Invite Control feature as well.

This capability, in addition to [Storage Control](/insomnia/storage-control) and the many other enterprise governance, compliance, and security capabilities in Insomnia, helps to ensure that your API assets are always secure and accessible only by authorized individuals in your organization.
