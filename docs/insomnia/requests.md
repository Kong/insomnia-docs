Insomnia supports sending requests via [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

To learn how to repurpose parts of your request, see
[Environment Variables](/insomnia/environment-variables).

## Send an HTTP request

Send an HTTP method request in a Document or Collection. The following instructions
assume you're starting with an empty Document or Collection.

In addition to standard HTTP methods, Insomnia supports [Custom HTTP Methods](#custom-http-methods).

1. In a Document, select the **Debug** tab, then **New Request**. In a Collection, select **New Request**.
1. In the **New Request** modal:
   1. Enter a request name.
   1. Select a method from the dropdown.
   1. Click **Create**.
1. Enter the API URL in the request URL input.
1. To add authentication, go to the **Auth** tab. Use the **Auth** dropdown to select your authentication method.
1. When you have entered your request URL and authentication, click **Send**.

See [Request Options](#request-options) to customize your request.

### Request Options

Modify any HTTP method or GraphQL request with the following options.

{:.table .table-striped}
Option | Description
------ | ------------
Body | Select a body type from the Body dropdown menu on the tab. Add content that you want to send in the body of the request.

To access existing custom methods, click on **Custom Method** in the methods dropdown.

## Send a gRPC request

Send a gRPC method request in a Document or Collection. The following instructions
