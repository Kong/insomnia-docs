## Insomnia Organizations

Insomnia Organizations is a great way for Insomnia Users to share Collections and Environments [safely](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/signup-and-auth) and [securely](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/data-encryption) with each other via Insomnia Cloud.

Organization members can create [snapshots](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/insomnia-sync#create-snapshot) and [branches](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/insomnia-sync#work-with-branches) on their collections.  They can checkout other organization member's snapshots and branches.
