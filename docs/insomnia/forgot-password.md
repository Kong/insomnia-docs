### Forgot Passwords

Due to the usage of [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol) to handle logging into the Insomnia App, the Insomnia Cloud never stores a user's passphrase in any form.  In addition, the derivation of encryption keys based on the user's password means that all user data is encrypted in a manner that requires the user's password to decrypt.

When Insomnia Passwords are forgotten, this means that synced Insomnia Request data cannot be decrypted.  Please create passwords with care.
