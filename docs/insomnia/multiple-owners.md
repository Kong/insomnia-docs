**Note**: This feature is only available for Enterprise subscriptions.

You can invite other users to become co-owners of your account and give them total or restricted access to all of your organizations, billing information, projects, and their members.

To make another user a co-owner, you'll need to make them a member of your enterprise first (e.g., send an invite that they need to accept).

In your Enterprise Controls, go to `Co-owners`. Then go to Members and search for the member you want to make a co-owner.

You can also assign special "Billing Only" permissions to that member without granting them all the other permissions of owners.
