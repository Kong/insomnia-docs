Request Collections are a way to group and share requests within Insomnia. All data, except for global settings, are stored at the request collection-level.

For working with API specifications, see [Design Documents](/insomnia/design-documents).

You can create, delete, and switch between Request Collections and Design Documents and tests from the Dashboard.
