## 1. Local Vault

### Overview

Local Vault is a storage option that allows all project data to be stored locally on your device. This option is ideal for users who prefer or require their data to remain off the cloud for privacy or security reasons.

### Key Features

- **Local Storage**: All project files are stored on your local machine.
- **No Cloud Interaction**: No data is sent to or stored in the cloud.
- **Security**: Enhanced security as data remains within your local environment.
- **Independence from Internet**: Access and work on your projects without needing an internet connection.

### Use Cases

- Organizations with strict data privacy regulations.
- Users working on sensitive projects that require enhanced security.
- Environments with limited or restricted internet access.

## 2. Cloud Sync

### Overview

Cloud Sync enables users to store and synchronize their project data in the cloud securely. This feature is beneficial for collaboration, providing easy access to projects from different devices and locations.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Ensures data is encrypted during transmission and storage.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Keeps your projects up-to-date across all devices.
- **Collaboration**: Share and collaborate on projects with team members.
- **Remote Access**: Access your projects from anywhere with an internet connection.

### Use Cases

- Teams requiring collaboration on API projects.
- Users who work from multiple locations or devices.
- Projects that benefit from centralized, cloud-based management.

## 3. Git Sync

### Overview
