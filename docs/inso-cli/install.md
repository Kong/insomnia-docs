Before you start, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (recommended version 12.x LTS).

Once you have installed Node.js, you can install Inso CLI globally on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g insomnia-inso`

Test that Inso CLI is installed by running:

`inso --version`
