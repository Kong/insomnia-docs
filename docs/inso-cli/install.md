Before you start, you will first need to install Node.js (recommended version 12.x LTS).

Once you have installed Node.js, you can install Inso CLI globally on your system by running the following code in your terminal:

`npm install -g insomnia-inso`

Test that Inso CLI is installed by running:

`inso --version`
